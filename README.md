# Syncthing-ID-same-on-two-devicesWHen pushing show ID I get same ID on both machines
Two computers were syncronizing perfectly but then for unknown reasons one of the PCs 
changed its ID to be the same as the other. So of course now syncing is impossible as 
Syncthing think they are the same PC and will only  log in one at a time. How do you 
change ID manually?
